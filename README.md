# .gg/termed

I'm not 100% sure if .gg/termed made the original because I'm not on their discord.
But according to <a href="https://github.com/hoemotion">@hoemotion</a>, .gg/termed stole from TheonlyIcebear.

See how they're the exact same code, only that TheonlyIcebear made it himself and EDITED it before ".gg/termed" copied it.
